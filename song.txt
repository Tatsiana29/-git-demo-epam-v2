I am sitting in the morning
At the diner on the corner
I am waiting at the counter
For the man to pour the coffee

And he fills it only halfway
And before I even argue
He is looking out the window
At somebody coming in

`It is always nice to see you`
Says the man behind the counter
To the woman who has come in
She is shaking her umbrella

And I look the other way
As they are kissing their hellos
I`m pretending not to see them
Instead I pour the milk

I open up the paper
There`s a story of an actor
Who had died while he was drinking
It was no one I had heard of
